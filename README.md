# iExpenses
It is an  expense tracker app that separates personal costs from business costs.

Challenge
- One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully       understand what’s going on.
- Add an Edit/Done button to ContentView so users can delete rows more easily.
- Modify the expense amounts in ContentView to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100     
  another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you.
- Add some validation to the Save button in AddView. If you enter “fish” or another thing that can’t be converted to an integer, show an alert telling users what     the problem is.
